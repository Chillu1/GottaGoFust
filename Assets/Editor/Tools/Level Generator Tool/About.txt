The Level Generator Tool is a simple tool,
created to help designers to create levels
easily and quickly, from an image source.

To Generate a level you need to select an 
image source,that should be the top down
map of your level, or the side view for a 
2D game.

By selecting the image source you get all 
the colors present in the image now you 
only need to assign a prefab and specify 
the name of the object that the color 
represents in your map.

The system generates a map creating 
the prefabs in the position corresponding
to its color's position in the picture.
