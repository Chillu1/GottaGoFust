## Disclaimer
Most of this projet is licensed under MIT. But some assets have their own license.
This is an old project of mine which I'm giving away the source code to since I won't find it usable anymore, and it might help some other learning gamedevs. Most of the code in this project is less than ideal, hence I was learning how to do stuff that that time.
