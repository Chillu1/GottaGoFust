## Disclaimer

Most of this project is licensed under MIT. But some assets have their own license. Everything that's imported, is most likely **not** licensed under MIT.
This is an old project of mine which I'm giving away the source code to since I won't find it usable anymore, and it might help some other learning gamedevs. Most of the code in this project is less than ideal, hence I was learning how to do stuff that that time.
